Welcome to my personal website ! 

I am a PhD candidate at [CREST](https://crest.science/) (ENSAE - Institut Polytechnique de Paris) under the supervision of Prof. [Bruno Cr√©pon](https://sites.google.com/site/brunocrepon/) and Prof. [Roland Rathelot](http://rolandrathelot.com/) since June 2024.

My main research interests lie in labor economics and public policies evaluation. More specifically, I focus on how information frictions affect the job matching process, labor market integration of foreign workers and discrimination related issues.

My work is conducted in collaboration with the French public employment agency ([France Travail](https://www.francetravail.fr/accueil/)).
