    <small>
      Theory suggests that job seekers set the level and direction of their search effort to maximize expected returns in the labor market. Yet this is a complex task as job seekers must process and interpret a large amount of information to form perceptions about the parameters that determine these returns. In addition, the current sanitary crisis may have exacerbated uncertainty about these labor market parameters. In this study, we explore if these perceptions are accurate and whether changing perceptions has an impact on job search behavior and job finding. Through a series of survey experiments, we measure baseline beliefs and then experimentally vary the provision of stylized and personalized information on the “true” parameters in a job seeker’s micro market. We then observe the impact of this information on three main outcomes: 1. updated beliefs about the local labor market, 2. search behavior, 3. employment outcomes.
