Welcome to my personal website ! 

I am a PhD candidate at [CREST](https://crest.science/) (ENSAE - Institut Polytechnique de Paris) under the supervision of Prof. [Bruno Cr√©pon](https://sites.google.com/site/brunocrepon/) and Prof. [Roland Rathelot](http://rolandrathelot.com/) since June 2024.

My main research interests lie in labor economics and public policies evaluation. More specifically, I focus on how information frictions shape job search behavior and employer hiring decisions. I study how these frictions contribute to inefficiencies in the labor market matching process.

In collaboration with the French public employment agency ([France Travail](https://www.francetravail.fr/accueil/)), I design and evaluate policy interventions to reduce those inefficiencies.
